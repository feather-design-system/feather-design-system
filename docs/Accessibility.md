One of our primary goals with Feather Design System is to have patterns and components that work for everyone. We strive to achieve this goal but understand that accessibility is ever evolving, with updates to technologies and new best practices emerging.

## Compliance

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) set standards to define accessibility for web sites. Our goal is to meet the WCAG 2.1 AA level of compliance.

## Feedback

We always welcome feedback, so if you have any or would like to report an accessibility please feel free to reach out to us in one of the following ways:

- [Create a Github issue](https://github.com/feather-design-system/feather-design-system/issues/new)
