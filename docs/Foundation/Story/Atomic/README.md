Feather DS is comprised of many layers of design and technology. As the design and engineering teams started building Feather, it became evident that the system’s scale would require a way to design and manage the smallest details while simultaneously considering component design and usage in the context of the entire system.

## Organizing Feather

The organization of Feather elements, components and patterns follows the concept of “Atomic Design.” This isn’t a new concept, as many design systems are built on a similar model. Feather employs the atomic design concept of organization to ensure that all parts are easy to analyze, organize and discuss. A large part of what makes Feather useful is the thought put into the harmony of the entire system.

## Forces

At the foundation most basic level of the universe, fundamental forces exist that dictate the organization and behavior of all structures. Forces like gravity and electromagnetism are analogous to styles and layout in Feather, since changing any of the parameters of these two fundamental theme components can create a huge impact to the entire system.

## Atoms

The next level up from the forces is the atom, the basic building block of all matter. Atoms are equivalent to elements in the Feather Design System, representing things like icons, individual blocks of type and geometry. These are the starting point for most component designs and can be combined to create more complex functional units.

## Molecules

Combining atoms creates molecules, which can be simple or complex depending on the design requirements. Molecules in Feather DS are represented by components. The components of Feather DS were designed using the fundamentals (styles) and the elements (atoms) required to satisfy real-world use cases. Components can even make use of sub-components, nesting functionality to create more complex components.

## System

The final level of Feather DS revolves around systems and ecosystems, the organization of many different components to achieve a specific UX goal. Systems are generally represented by pages, while ecosystems are represented by the application or platform. When thinking about real-world systems, whether it’s the solar system or an ocean ecosystem, the behaviors of these systems all rely on the impact that the fundamental forces have on the constituents. Forces all act on atoms, which combined form molecules, which form organisms (which are also systems) - eventually leading to ecosystems.
