# Drawer

## Component

<hr />

## Anatomy

![Anatomy](./assets/Drawers_-_Anatomy.png)

### Lightbox

- A lightbox can be used to prevent the user from interacting with the screen behind the drawer.
- The following forms of lightbox are supported
- (default) dark light box (e.g. carry out a child action)

### Surface

- The frame will host the content and take up as much space as required
- The frame will be anchored to one of the right of the browser window
- The surface should contain a neutral color - either the Feather background or surface color
- The frame should be elevated to 8px / dp

### Action Button Bar

- Only present if there is at least one action button to be displayed
- Allows user to quickly navigate through top levels panels within the drawer
- The number of action should be kept to a minimum

### Header

- The header should be short but descriptive
- BEST PRACTICE: The header should reflect the control being used to display the dialog e.g.
- if generated by a context menu such as ‘Search’ then the header might be ‘Search Providers’
- The title should consist only of text (do not include icons)
- The title may also contain the following optional elements

### Close (X) (optional)

- The close (X) icon should be placed at the top right of the panel
- A drawer can also be closed by pressing the ESCAPE key
- Clicking the close (X) should dismiss the drawer and no changes should be applied (same as cancel option)

### Main Content

- The main content should be formatted as required and may include a wide variety of controls and text styles. Examples include:
  - Text blocks
  - Cards
  - Toggles
  - Check Boxes
  - Radio Buttons

## Behavior

### Drawer Behavior

- The drawer will appear from the righ edge of the screen
- A drawer may take up as much screen space as required but must leave a minimum of 32px of the parent screen at the edge furthest from the opening point
- Drawers should use a “slide-in” animation, or “translate-X”
  - The drawer opens by sliding right from the left hand edge of the browser window
  - The drawer closes by sliding left into the left hand edge of the browser window
  - When triggered the drawer should slide out gracefully from the appropriate browser edge
  - Drawer animations should take place over 280ms
- The default background colour for the drawer is --feather-surface
- A drawer should be elevated over other components on the page
- A scrim / lightbox should be used behind a drawer
  - use a darkened lightbox if the desire is for the user to focus on the drawer and does not need to see the host screen
- Multiple drawers cannot be overlaid on top of each other nor can drawers be nested
  - opening a drawer from the same edge of the browser window should cause any other drawer opened on that edge to close
  - BEST PRACTICE: a drawer should not trigger another drawer. If another panel is needed it should be opened in the current drawer
- The page scroll bars should generally be hidden when a drawer is opened
  - the drawer should be just large enough to contain the content it has to display plus any padding
- drawers should stretch the full height of the browser window
- In rare cases, a drawer may be offset from the top of the browser window (e.g. below the main title bar)
- right hand edge has single pixel line
- action buttons bar will be to the left of the drawer and stretch the full height of the drawer

### Drawer Tabs

- Only present if there is at least one action button to display
- Should be composed of light icons on a dark background to provide separation from the main drawer content
- Contains one or more icon buttons sized at 40px x 40px
  - may also contain section separators consisting of a divider
- Selecting an action button should cause the panel associated with action to be displayed inside the drawer
  - If there is any unsaved data then the user should be warned via a modal dialog (positioned central within the drawer in a transparent light box).
- Action buttons should only provide access to the top level panels (i.e. do not include access to purely child panels)
- For vertical action button bars the first action button should be
  - (header present) aligned with the bottom of the header
  - (no header present) 8px from the top of the action button bar

### Header

- The header appears at the very top of the drawer and stretches the full width of the drawer content area
  - if the action button bar is present then the header stretches from action button bar to the browser edge
- Header will use a text selection from the “heading” category
- At the right hand edge of the header will be a close button
  - If clicked this will close the drawer and give control back to the host page.
- If there are unsaved changes in the drawer then a modal dialog should appear over the drawer. The positioning of the dialog should be that the close (X) is in roughly the same position as the close (X) of the drawer (this means an accidental double-click will close the dialog with the risk of losing changes (see image below).
- Where appropriate, when a drawer is closed focus should be given back to the control that caused the drawer to be opened.
  - Example 1: User selects an action button that opens a drawer. When the drawer closes focus is given back to the action button
  - Example 2: For the provider picker there is initially a button on the screen to open the drawer. If the user cancels or closes the drawer without selecting anything then focus should be given back to that button. If the user selects something then the button is replaced with a card - focus should be given to the card.

### Main Content

The main content will be made up of one or more panels

- each action button will link to a panel and display that when selected
- the user may drilldown to one or more child panels to display additional information

Each panel serves to host most other controls

BEST PRACTICE: The drawer width should be sympathetic towards the content it is expected to contain

- if the user is navigating panels within the drawer and the new panel requires more or less space then the drawer should gracefully expand and contract to show the content.
- If there are many panels within the drawer then the design should ensure that the sizes are kept as consistent as possible to avoid too much white space and too many different sizes of drawer
- BEST PRACTICE: limit the number of sizes to 1 - 3 for any instance
- Different instances may use different sized drawers

A scroll bar will appear if there is more content than can be accommodated within the vertical height of the browser window

- The need for a scrollbar will be determined based on the panel to be displayed
- The page scrollbar should be hidden when the drawer opens and reshown when the drawer closes.

Padding should exist between the action button bar and the main content

Padding to the right should also accommodate a scrollbar (if applicable)

Separators, accordion headers, cards etc. may extend fully across the drawer width

If there is more content than can be displayed in the height of the panel then the panel should be allowed to scroll

- there should be 32px vertical padding after the last item of content

SUGGESTED BEST PRACTICE: The code for drawer content should be such that it can be hosted in multiple drawers.

### Modal Behavior

- The user cannot interact with the screen behind. Tabbing should be limited to the controls within the drawer and the browser controls.

## Accessibility

- All features of the drawer should be accessible via screen readers and keyboard controls
- Keyboard users should be bounded by controls within the drawer (i.e. no access to screen behind until drawer is closed).
- When a drawer is displayed it should be announced, followed by the header and the panel content
- The action button is bar and its contents should be available upon request
- Generally speaking it should be possible to close a drawer by pressing the escape key
- On opening, focus should be given to the action button for the panel being displayed
  - Also see https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel for behaviour of within the action button list
  - The first tab will take the user to the first control on the related panel
  - for forms this would be the first input field
  - for non-forms this might be the first button, or a table or a list etc.
  - only give focus to the close (X) initially if the form contains no other focusable elements)
- On closing, focus should be given to the control used to trigger the drawer in the first place.
- The natural tab order of elements within each panel in the drawer should be used as much as possible (top left to bottom right).
  - Tab on last focusable element will go back to the first focusable element
  - Shift-tab on first focusable element will go to the last focusable element

## Responsive Behavior

- Drawers should never totally fill the screen
- Drawers should remain at the same size until it is not possible to fit them on the screen (i.e. they do not simply get bigger because the screen is bigger)
- The content of the drawer should be responsive for smaller screens so that it still provides a good user experience
