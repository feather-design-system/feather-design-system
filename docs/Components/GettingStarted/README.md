## Intro

FeatherDS components are built using [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/). If you haven't already set up your Vue3 project we recommend either using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#overview) or [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) to get your project set up and running.

## Prerequisites

- [Node v14.15.0 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
