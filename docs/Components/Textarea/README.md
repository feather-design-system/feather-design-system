## Example

<Textarea-Examples />

## Usage

Use text field area when a user needs to provide more than a single line of input text.

In general, the height of the text field should be determined based on a number of factors such as context, expected input length and available space.

By default text field areas should be static, providing a scrollbar to users if the text falls outside the bounds of the container.

### When to use

- Use a text field area when the user input required may wrap to a second line.
- Text field areas may be found in dialogs and forms often and are sometimes used on surfaces and in tables.

### When Not to use

- Text field areas should never be used when the text input is expected to be shorter than 1 line of text.
- Never use text field areas where the layout doesnâ€™t support it - text field areas should be wide enough to accomodate at least 40 characters. In some very rare circumstances they may be used with as few as 20 characters, but this should be a last resort.
- Text field areas should never be used when the input requires a mask. For example, if a user needs to input a series of phone numbers, a text field area with dash characters should not be used.

### Events

- `update:modelValue` - emitted when there is a new value.

### data-ref-ids

- `feather-input` - on the `textarea` element
- `feather-form-element-label` - on the `label` text element
- `feather-form-element-hint` - on the hint text element
- `feather-form-element-error` - on the error text element
- `feather-form-element-count` - on the maxlength text element

### Attributes

Specifying an `class` or `data-ref-id` attribute will cause them to be applied to the components root containing `div`. All other attributes are inherited to the `textarea` were it makes sense. Some will be ignored as they will conflict with some of the attributes we need to use for accessibility.

#### Class

Use the `class` attribute to specify custom spacing needed for the element.

#### data-ref-id

Use the `data-ref-id` attribute when you need to access the element for E2E testing.
