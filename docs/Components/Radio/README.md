## Design

The Radio button design has been kept minimal â€“ understanding that the component will likely be used in a form with other components. The animation, however, has been built-in the add visual interest and to more importantly convey important feedback to the user.

## Example

<Radio-Examples />

## Usage

Radio buttons enable a user to make a single selection among a group of options. When using a Radio, it's recommended to list options in a logical order (alphabetically, numerically, etc.) and include at least 2 or more options. By default, it's recommended to have no Radio selected unless there is a most likely or recommended selection.

## Radio

Radio buttons should be used in a [RadioGroup](#RadioGroup). The Radio Group will provide a lot more functionality that should be used in a form. Radio is simply a radio button without any functionality that a form will need.
